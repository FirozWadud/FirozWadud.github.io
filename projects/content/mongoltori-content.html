    <p class="article-text">
      BRACU Mongol-Tori is a pioneering Mars rover project developed by BRAC University's robotics team. The name "Mongol-Tori" comes from the Bengali words for "Mars" (Mongol) and "Boat" (Tori), symbolizing our journey to explore the red planet.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      Comprehending the significance of teamwork and cooperation in the voyage of discovering greatness, the team has successfully combined their skills and efforts to build a rover capable of aiding inquisitive observers to discover the unknown and perform science-related verification tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      The project is led by a group of tech enthusiasts from different departments, mostly consisting of engineering students with BRAC University's Robotic Club (ROBU) serving as a parent organization for financial and mechanical engineering support.

  <!-- Technical Systems section -->
  <div class="article-section" id="technical">
    <h2 class="section-title">Technical Systems</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Mechanical Design</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
      The rover's mechanical design has been optimized through several iterations. The chassis evolved from a K-shape to an H-shape design, measuring 0.7m long and 0.55m wide. The triangulation installed in the chassis reduces deformation during rough terrain traversal by transmitting loads as tension and compression along each strut.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      The wheels are 0.3m in diameter and 0.10m wide, constructed with a stainless steel ring via U-shaped rim. To reduce weight while maintaining strength, small holes were drilled in the wheels. Rubber pads are used on the wheels for better grip when climbing rocks, performing 360-degree rotation, and handling vertical drops.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      A unique feature is the extender system that increases the length of the rover's base from 0.76m to 1.2m, preventing it from flipping over during vertical drops and providing greater stability on steep slopes.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Control Systems</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
      The rover uses an ATMega2560 microcontroller to process commands. For wheel control, back EMF protected 30A motor drivers provide smooth PWM operation. The arm uses 13A motor drivers and 10A relay modules for precise movements. A reverse polarity protection circuit using Schottky diodes protects against unexpected errors.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      The control station features a custom GUI built in Java that follows TCP/IP protocol, with the base station acting as the client and the rover as the server. A feedback system allows for precise control of feedback end effectors. For science operations, a separate GUI provides real-time sensor readings with graphical visualization.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Autonomous Navigation</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
      For autonomous traversal, the rover employs a Pixhawk 4.0 with ardurover firmware and a Radiolink SE100 GPS-Compass module, achieving positioning accuracy within 50cm. The "Mission Planner" interface allows for waypoint setting, holding positions, and creating search patterns using loiter mode.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      Object detection is handled by an Rplidar that rotates 360 degrees, firing 150,000 laser pulses per second. AR tag recognition uses image processing with OpenCV through contour detection and homography, with an accuracy of approximately 80%.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Power System</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
      The power system has evolved from separate batteries to a centralized power distribution system. The 2021 design uses five 8000mAh Lithium Jump Starter batteries, chosen for ease of charging, portability, and flight security clearance. This configuration provides an average runtime of 48 minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
      Earlier designs used 10,000mAh Li-Po batteries (2019) and later six 10,000mAh batteries (2020) with an average run time of 45 minutes. A high-ampere kill switch provides emergency shutdown capability in line with competition safety requirements.

      The sample collection system can extract around 80-100 grams of soil per grab using an excavator claw that can dig up to 20cm deep. For amino acid detection, ninhydrin reagent is used with a heat generator to identify potential biomarkers. The system also includes digital microscopy for examining soil composition at magnifications up to 800x.

    </p>
    
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Subsystem Testing</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
      Individual components are first evaluated using Solidworks simulation before physical implementation. Subsystems including wheels, suspension, chassis, end effectors, and the sample collector are tested separately. Custom test fixtures, such as ramps for wheel testing and object manipulation trials for arm testing, are used to validate specific functionalities.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Complete System Testing</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
      After assembly, full system integration tests evaluate how components work together. Communication systems, electronic configurations, robotic arm operation, and end effector functionality are tested as a complete unit. The team verifies that all systems can maintain reliable operation for the expected mission duration.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Operational Testing</h3>
    <p class="article-text">
      Final testing replicates competition conditions at remote locations with terrain similar to the Mars Desert Research Station. The team conducts trials for each competition task: Extreme Retrieval and Delivery, Equipment Servicing, Autonomous Traversal, and Science Task. Each operation is performed within time constraints to simulate competition pressure.

      The BRACU Mongol-Tori project continues to evolve with each iteration, with several development areas planned for future versions:
    </p>
    <ul style="color: var(--light-gray); margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Enhanced autonomous capabilities with advanced machine learning algorithms for more adaptive terrain navigation</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Expanded scientific analysis capabilities, including more sophisticated sample analysis tools</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Further refinement of the cartesian arm design for improved precision in sample collection</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Integration of AI-based object recognition to improve target identification during missions</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Optimization of power management systems to extend operational duration</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article-text">
      This project has not only produced a successful rover prototype but has also provided invaluable hands-on experience for students interested in robotics, space exploration, and interdisciplinary engineering challenges. The experience gained through international competitions continues to inform future designs and educational opportunities at BRAC University.
