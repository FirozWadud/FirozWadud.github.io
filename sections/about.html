      My hands trembled slightly as I connected the final IoT module to our fire detection system. This was not a lab assignment; it was a system that would be installed in Dhaka's most densely populated slums, where fires spread within minutes and often claim lives. When the residents gathered to watch our demonstration, their applause meant more than any academic recognition I'd ever received.

      I'm Firoz Wadud, a robotics engineer whose journey has been guided by a simple belief: technology should bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and tangible human needs. From leading the BRACU Mongol-Tori Mars rover team to developing agricultural robots with 6DOF manipulators, I've consistently sought to create solutions that matter.

      When not immersed in code or circuit boards, you'll find me sketching portraits, designing 3D models, or quietly tending to my garden â€“ activities that balance precision with creativity, much like my approach to engineering challenges.
